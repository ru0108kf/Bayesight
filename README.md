# Bayesight

Bayesight is a powerful tool designed to help you efficiently find optimal solutions to complex problems by harnessing the power of Bayesian optimization. It intelligently balances **exploration** (searching new, uncertain areas) and **exploitation** (improving on the best-known results) to guide you to the best outcome with minimal effort.

## Features

  * **Efficient Optimization**: Bayesight makes smarter choices about where to sample next, reducing the number of costly experiments or simulations needed to find the optimal solution.
  * **Balance of Exploration & Exploitation**: It intelligently navigates the trade-off between exploring new parameter spaces and exploiting the most promising known areas.
  * **Intuitive Insights**: Beyond just finding a solution, the tool's probabilistic approach provides valuable insights into the problem space, helping you make more informed decisions.
  * **Flexible & Scalable**: Designed to work with various objective functions and constraints, Bayesight is adaptable to a wide range of applications, from engineering to machine learning.

## Why Bayesight?

The name "Bayesight" is a portmanteau of "Bayesian" and "Insight." It reflects the core purpose of this tool: to provide profound insights derived from a Bayesian framework. It's not just about getting an answer; it's about gaining a deeper understanding of your problem to make smarter, data-driven decisions.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply install the required dependencies using pip.

```bash
pip install botorch
```

## How to Use

The basic workflow is as follows:

1.  **Define Your Objective Function**: Write the function you want to optimize.
2.  **Generate Initial Data**: Create a small, initial set of data points.
3.  **Run the Optimization Loop**: Repeatedly run the core loop, which involves:
      * Updating the model with new data.
      * Optimizing the acquisition function to find new candidate points.
      * Evaluating the new candidates and adding them to your dataset.
